1) Fix image size - for both models 
2) Fix readability in Optimized models
3) The tabs only showed when the image is selected - that shouldn't be the case tha tabs should be visible nontheless
4) Selecting Clear results - do clear result but donot deselect the selected image
5) Give pdf and ask if result are as expected why is FPS gain?
6) How can we calculate model size in optimization
7) There are few yellow alerts i don't want that
8) After Selecting Detect Defects there should be a success message that tells that the task is done


Fix 2:
1) Success message still showing sometimes butnot always
2) Give comparison result - the result is varying everytime, and optimized detected less , why? this means our accuracy is compromising with optimization, such optimization isn't considered good
3) CHange Image button isn't working - it is expected to let user open another image

What is iou threshold?

Fix 3:
1) CHange Image Actually removes every image so user can change shared image - that's not how it should work well i want change image to remove the image specifically for baseline and use model on that changed image(new one) not as shared image, similarly the change image in optimized tab should change image for optimization model not shared image (The sequence should be -> use shared image as baseline if user selects change image then change image for that tab/model)
2) Clear Result -> Clear all result and removes shared image -> it should not remove shared image 
3) Give comparison pdf -> the check detection .py gives 2 detection and here in baseline we get 3? Ican't tell in presentation oh i check it should be 2 or blah blah, we need to have same number of detections


Fix 4:
1) Give Comparison pdf and check if it's correct?
2) The results are sometime inconsistent that means sometimes baseline also comes faster may be due to warm up thing earlier
3) What is iou threshold?
4) Technical Report
